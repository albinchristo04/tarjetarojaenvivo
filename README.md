*   **Google Search Console**:

    2.  You will need to verify ownership of your domain. Follow the instructions provided by Google.
    3.  Once verified, go to the "Sitemaps" section in the left sidebar.
    4.  Enter `sitemap.xml` in the "Add a new sitemap" field and click "Submit".

*   **Bing Webmaster Tools**:

### 2. Add More Content

### 3. Add a `robots.txt` file

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

This tells all crawlers that they are allowed to crawl the entire site and points them to the sitemap.
